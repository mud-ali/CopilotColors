#Color Inverter
## Made mostly by Github Copilot

##### A project idea I saw on the internet and decided to have Github Copilot help me make

Things I noted
 - Not very good at CSS
 - javascript worked fairly well, did not need comments to prompt
 - CSS
     -  Had to prompt with comments mostly
     -  Tended to misinterpret comments
     -  Autogenerated repetitive comments that did not describe the following code
     -  Repeatedly attempted to stretch all elements to `width: 100%` and `height: 100%;`
